The team has since grown to over 40 collaborators.\n\nA panel study is a longitudinal study that follows the same individuals over time. A panel study is different from a census, which samples the population as a whole over time, without tracking individuals. \n\nThe NZAVS  maintains an up-to-date contact list as participants move house, change names, change telephone accounts, and change email addresses. The study's personalised telephone campaigns, holiday cards, and participant prize draws have enabled the NZAVS to maintain a remarkably high annual sample retention rate of 80%. (Many longitudinal studies achieve only 20% retention.)\n\nEach year, the NZAVS surveys health, personality, relationships, employment, values, beliefs, and habits within the same people. The study has received responses from 61,535 New Zealanders. Its most recent wave (2019/20) received longitudinal responses from 36,524 New Zealanders. This is about 1\\% of New Zealand's adult population. The NZAVS is distinct from other national panel studies for the breadth of its survey questions with broad coverage in political and social psychology, health, and religion/spirituality and for its temporal scale, which encompasses 12 longitudinal waves. Time-series data within the same individuals across a diverse population are powerful because they enable a systematic understanding of the complex interplay between human social and psychological processes that occur within people as they respond to consequential events in our lives (\"natural experiments\") [@nzavs2021]. \n\n<!-- The NZAVS is distinct from other panel studies for the breadth of its survey questions that were purposely crafted to investigate what makes life good, and what imperils these goods, -->\n  \n  \n  \n## Where can I go for futher information? \n\nThe NZAVS website is maintained by Prof Chris Sibley.[Link](https://www.psych.auckland.ac.nz/en/about/new-zealand-attitudes-and-values-study.html)\n## Link to data dictionary and questions\n  \n  [Link to full data dictionary](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/but0pz9h4jdpy6f/NZAVS-Technical-Documents-e02-Data-Dictionary.xlsx?dl=0)\n\n[Link to questions only](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/cv256sbjal4ucvo/nzavs-data-dictionary.htm?dl=0)\n\n\n",
