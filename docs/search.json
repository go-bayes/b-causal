    "text": "Causal inference\nSuppose we want to infer whether a dichotomous exposure has a causal effect. We must answer three questions:\n\nWhat would happen with exposure?\nWhat would happen with no exposure?\nDo these potential outcomes differ?\n\nConsider a binary exposure \\(A\\) with two levels, \\(A = 0\\) and \\(A=1\\) and a continuous outcome \\(Y\\).  Estimating the causal effect of \\(A\\) on outcome \\(Y\\) requires contrasting two states of the world.  The state of the the world \\(Y^{a=1}\\) when, perhaps contrary to fact, \\(A\\) is set to \\(1\\) and the state of the world \\(Y^{a=0}\\) when, perhaps contrary to fact, \\(A\\) is set to \\(0\\). We say that \\(A\\) affects \\(Y\\)  when the quantities$Y^{a=1} - Y^{a=0} \\neq 0$ (Hernan and Robins 2023) .  \n\nThe fundamental problem of causal inference.\nAt any given time, for any individual, at most only one level of the exposure \\(A\\) may be realised. That is, \\(Y^{a=1}\\) and \\(Y^{a=0}\\) are never simultaneously observed in any individual.  As such, individual-level causal effects are not typically identified in the data. This is referred to as “the fundamental problem of causal inference” (Rubin 1976; Gelman, Hill, and Vehtari 2020). \\(Y^{a=1}\\) and \\(Y^{a=0}\\) are therefore called “potential” or “counterfactual” outcomes.\nAlthough we cannot generally observed causal effects in any individual, when certain assumptions are satisfied, we may identify the average or marginal causal effect at the level of a population.  We say there is an average or marginal causal effect if the difference of the averages of those who are exposed and are not exposed does not equal zero:  \\(E(Y^{a=1}) - E(Y^{a=0})\\neq 0\\) . Because the difference of the means is equivalent to the mean of the differences, we may equivalently say there is an marginal causal effect if \\(E(Y^{a=1} - Y^{a=0})\\neq 0\\) (Hernan and Robins 2023). ^[Our example uses a binary exposure but we may contrast the counterfactual outcomes for two levels of a continuous exposure. However, to do this wee must state the levels of exposure at which we seek comparisons.] \nCritically, to ensure valid inference, the potential outcomes must be (conditionally) independent of the exposure: \n\\[Y^a  \\perp\\!\\!\\!\\perp A|L\\]\nOr equivalently:\n\\[A \\perp\\!\\!\\!\\perp Y^a |L\\]\nOutside of controlled experiments we cannot generally ensure this conditional independence. For this reason, we use sensitivity analysis, such as the E-value (VanderWeele, Mathur, and Chen 2020)"

    "text": "The steps for G-computation\n\nFirst we fit a regression for each outcome on the exposure \\(A\\_{t0}\\) and baseline covariates\\(\\boldsymbol{L} = (L_1, L_2,L_3 \\dots L_n)\\). To avoid implausible assumptions of linearity we model the relationship between the exposure each of the potential outcomes of interest using a cubic spline.  We include in the set of baseline confounders \\(\\boldsymbol{L}\\) the baseline measure of the exposure as well as the baseline response (or responses):\n\n\\[\\{A\\_{t-1}, \\boldsymbol{Y_{t-1}} = (Y_{1, t-1}, Y_{2, t-1}, Y_{3, t-1}\\dots Y_{n, t-1})\\} \\subset \\boldsymbol{L}\\]  \nThis gives us\n\\[E(Y|A, \\boldsymbol{L})\\]\n\nSecond, we use the model in (1) to predict the values of a potential outcome \\(Y^{a}\\) by setting the exposure to the value \\(A = a\\).\n\nThis gives us\n\\[\\hat{E}(Y|A = a, \\boldsymbol{L})\\]\n\nThird, we use the model in (1) to predict the values of a different potential outcome \\(Y^{a*}\\)by setting the exposure to a different value of \\(A =a^{\\star}\\).\n\nThis gives us \n\\[\\hat{E}(Y|A = a*,\\boldsymbol{L})\\]\n\nForth we obtain the focal contrast as the expected difference in the expected average outcomes when exposure at levels \\(a*\\) and \\(a\\). Where outcomes are continuous we calculate both mean of \\(Y^a\\) and the mean of  \\(Y^{a*}\\) and then obtain their difference.  This gives us: \n\n\\[\\hat{ATE} = \\hat{E}[\\hat{E}(Y|A = a, \\boldsymbol{L}) - \\hat{E}(Y|A = a*, \\boldsymbol{L})]\\]\n\nWhere outcomes are binary, we calculate the causal risk ratio in moving between the different levels of A. Where binary outcomes are more common than 10% we use a log-normal model to calculate a causal rate ratio (VanderWeele, Mathur, and Chen 2020). \nThe stdReg package in R calculates standard errors using the Delta method from which we construct confidence intervals under asymptotic assumptions(Sjölander 2016). Additionally, we pool uncertainty arising from the multiple imputation procedure by employing Rubin’s Rules."

A panel study is different from a census, which samples the population as a whole over time, without tracking individuals.\nTime-series data within the same individuals across a diverse population are powerful because they enable a systematic understanding of the causal interplay between human social and psychological processes that occur within people as they respond to consequential events in our lives (“natural experiments”).\nThe NZAVS maintains an up-to-date contact list as participants move house, change names, change telephone accounts, and change email addresses. The study’s personalised telephone campaigns, holiday cards, and participant prize draws have enabled the NZAVS to maintain a remarkably high annual sample retention rate of 70-80%. (Many longitudinal studies achieve only 20% retention.)\nEach year, the NZAVS surveys health, personality, relationships, employment, values, beliefs, and habits within the same people. The study has received responses from 69,021 New Zealanders. Its most recent wave (2021/22) received longitudinal responses from over 33,000 New Zealanders. This is about 1% of New Zealand’s adult population. The NZAVS is distinct from other national panel studies for the breadth of its survey questions with broad coverage in political and social psychology, health, and religion/spirituality and for its temporal scale, which encompasses 13 longitudinal waves."

    "text": "Figure 1: Confounding control using three waves of data & multiple imputation of responses lost-to-follow-up\n\n\n\n\nConfounding occurs when the statistical association between indicators in the data do not reflect a causal association between parameters in a target population. A causal graph is a qualitative tool that enables us to quickly inspect sources of confounding.\nWe may represent our strategy for confounding control using the causal graph presented in Figure 1.\nWe define an exposure or treatment by $A$. We define \\(\\boldsymbol{Y}\\) as the set of all well-being outcomes contained in the NZAVS. Our interest is in consistently estimating the causal effect of congregation size on each of these outcomes. To consistently estimate the causal effect of an exposure \\(A=1\\) on the vector of well-being outcomes \\(\\boldsymbol{Y}\\) we must ensure that we have included a set of confounders that will prevent any statistical association between \\(A\\) and \\(Y\\) in the absence of causation. A statistical association in the absence of a causal association may arise in one of three ways.: (1) \\(A\\) and \\(Y\\) share a common cause. (2) \\(A\\) and \\(Y\\) share a common effect. (3) There is confounding by descent, such that conditioning on a confounder introduces a statistical association between \\(A\\) and \\(Y\\) in the absence of a casual association (collider bias).\nTo address challenge (1) we may condition or stratify on all measured common causes of \\(A\\) and \\(Y\\). To address challenges (2) and (3), we must not condition on any effect or desendent of an effect. Note however that by conditioning on a descent of a common cause we may at least partially address conditioning by a common cause. This is because conditioning on the effect of a common cause may itself partially block the effect of the that common cause.\nIn NZAVS outcome-wide science studies we use a modified version of VanderWeele et al’s approach for estimating outcome-wide causal effects (VanderWeele, Mathur, and Chen 2020).\nVanderWeele’s approach utilises three waves of panel data collected within the same participants over time.\nCall \\(t-1\\) the baseline wave, \\(t_0\\) the exposure wave, and \\(t+1\\) the outcome measurement wave. First, we include at baseline indicators of all past outcomes \\(\\boldsymbol{Y}_{t-1}\\). Second, we include at baseline an indicator for the past exposure \\(A_{t-1}\\). Third, we include a rich set of baseline confounders \\(\\boldsymbol{L_{t-1}}\\). Of course, we cannot ensure that this strategy is sufficient to ensure no unmeasured confounding. However, on On VanderWeele’s strategy, for any unmeasured confounder to affect both the exposure/outcome association, it would need to do so independently of its effects on prior measurements of the exposure and (all) outcomes at baseline, in addition to all measured baseline confounders. Note also that by controlling for measured confounders the wave prior to exposure we avoid unwittingly conditioning on an effects of the exposure that subsequently affects the outcome – mediator bias. Note furthermore that by measuring the outcome in the year following the exposure, \\(Y_{t+1}\\), we ensure that the exposure temporally precedes the outcome, and is not, for example, an effect of the outcome. Finally, loss-to-follow-up or attrition, as well as survey non-response may introduce selection bias (represented by the boxed \\(S_{t+1}\\)). There are several ways in which uch selection bias may introduce confounding. In Figure 1, we note the prospect in which a novel common cause of \\(A\\) and \\(Y\\) called \\(U_s\\) may lead to a spurious association between \\(A\\) and \\(Y\\) if \\(S\\) is a collider of \\(A\\) and \\(U_s\\). To avoid selection bias we multiply impute the missing responses.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nVanderWeele, Tyler J, Maya B Mathur, and Ying Chen. 2020. “Outcome-Wide Longitudinal Designs for Causal Inference: A New Template for Empirical Studies.” Statistical Science 35 (3): 437466.\n\nReuseCC BY-NC-SACitationBibTeX citation:@online{bulbulia2022,\n  author = {Joseph Bulbulia},\n  title = {Outcome-Wide {Science} in {NZAVS} {Studies}},\n  date = {2022-11-05},\n  url = {https://go-bayes.github.io/b-causal-lab/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nJoseph Bulbulia. 2022. “Outcome-Wide Science in NZAVS\nStudies.” November 5, 2022. https://go-bayes.github.io/b-causal-lab/."

    "text": "Summary of findings\nOverall, New Zealanders do not perceive the risks of COVID-19 to be exaggerated, however there is somewhat greater perception of exaggeration this year compared to last year.\nThere is an increasing belief that COVID-19 was manufactured in a laboratory.\nOverall, New Zealanders express high levels of trust in the New Zealand Government response to COVID-19, but levels have declined somewhat during the past year.\nSimilarly, New Zealanders are generally satisfied with the New Zealand Government response to COVID-19, but levels of trust have declined somewhat during the past year.\nImportantly, these models do not adjust for bias from NZAVS sample attrition. The NZAVS is independent of government. However, to the extent that institutional mistrust of the government has extended to scientific institutions, lower trust and satisfaction with the government response to COVID-19 will have been somewhat greater than reported in the retained NZAVS sample.\nIn future work, we shall account for the bias from sample attrition using multiple imputation.\nWe will report our results here."
