    "text": "Figure 1: Confounding control using three waves of data & multiple imputation of responses lost-to-follow-up in which an unmeasured cause affects both selection and the outcome, introducing bias.\n\n\n\n\nConfounding occurs when the statistical association between indicators in the data do not reflect a causal association between parameters in a target population. A causal diagramme is a qualitative tool that enables us to quickly inspect sources of confounding.\nWe may represent our strategy for confounding control using the causal graph presented in Figure 1.\nFigure 2 presents another causal graph in which selection may introduce bias.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Confounding control using three waves of data & multiple imputation of responses lost-to-follow-up in which the outcome affects selection, introducing bias\n\n\n\n\nWe define an exposure or treatment by \\(A\\). We define \\(\\boldsymbol{Y}\\) as the set of all well-being outcomes contained in the NZAVS. Our interest is in consistently estimating the causal effect of congregation size on each of these outcomes. To consistently estimate the causal effect of an exposure \\(A=1\\) on the vector of well-being outcomes \\(\\boldsymbol{Y}\\) we must ensure that we have included a set of confounders that will prevent any statistical association between \\(A\\) and \\(Y\\) in the absence of causation. A statistical association in the absence of a causal association may arise in one of three ways.: (1) \\(A\\) and \\(Y\\) share a common cause. (2) \\(A\\) and \\(Y\\) share a common effect. (3) There is confounding by descent, such that conditioning on a confounder introduces a statistical association between \\(A\\) and \\(Y\\) in the absence of a casual association (collider bias).\nTo address challenge (1) we may condition or stratify on all measured common causes of \\(A\\) and \\(Y\\). To address challenges (2) and (3), we must not condition on any effect or descendent of an effect. Note however that by conditioning on a descent of a common cause we may at least partially address conditioning by a common cause. This is because conditioning on the effect of a common cause may itself partially block the effect of the that common cause.\nIn NZAVS outcome-wide science studies we use a modified version of VanderWeele et al’s approach for estimating outcome-wide causal effects (VanderWeele, Mathur, and Chen 2020).\nVanderWeele’s approach utilises three waves of panel data collected within the same participants over time.\nCall \\(t-1\\) the baseline wave, \\(t_0\\) the exposure wave, and \\(t+1\\) the outcome measurement wave. First, we include at baseline indicators of all past outcomes \\(\\boldsymbol{Y}_{t-1}\\). Second, we include at baseline an indicator for the past exposure \\(A_{t-1}\\). Third, we include a rich set of baseline confounders \\(\\boldsymbol{L_{t-1}}\\). Of course, we cannot ensure that this strategy is sufficient to ensure no unmeasured confounding. However, on On VanderWeele’s strategy, for any unmeasured confounder to affect both the exposure/outcome association, it would need to do so independently of its effects on prior measurements of the exposure and (all) outcomes at baseline, in addition to all measured baseline confounders. Note also that by controlling for measured confounders the wave prior to exposure we avoid unwittingly conditioning on an effects of the exposure that subsequently affects the outcome – mediator bias. Note furthermore that by measuring the outcome in the year following the exposure, \\(Y_{t+1}\\), we ensure that the exposure temporally precedes the outcome, and is not, for example, an effect of the outcome. Finally, loss-to-follow-up or attrition, as well as survey non-response may introduce selection bias (represented by the boxed \\(S_{t+1}\\)). There are several ways in which uch selection bias may introduce confounding. In Figure 1, we note the prospect in which a novel common cause of \\(A\\) and \\(Y\\) called \\(U_s\\) may lead to a spurious association between \\(A\\) and \\(Y\\) if \\(S\\) is a collider of \\(A\\) and \\(U_s\\). To avoid selection bias we multiply impute the missing responses.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nVanderWeele, Tyler J, Maya B Mathur, and Ying Chen. 2020. “Outcome-Wide Longitudinal Designs for Causal Inference: A New Template for Empirical Studies.” Statistical Science 35 (3): 437466.\n\nReuseCC BY-NC-SACitationBibTeX citation:@online{bulbulia2022,\n  author = {Joseph Bulbulia},\n  title = {Outcome-Wide {Science} in {NZAVS} {Studies}},\n  date = {2022-11-05},\n  url = {https://go-bayes.github.io/b-causal-lab/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nJoseph Bulbulia. 2022. “Outcome-Wide Science in NZAVS\nStudies.” November 5, 2022. https://go-bayes.github.io/b-causal-lab/."

    "text": "Follow up: Bayesian models impute missing outcomes arising from loss to follow up\nPanel studies follow the same people over time. There is typically attrition of any panel over time. Where attrition is related to the outcomes of interest, this can lead to selection bias. That is, responses can be higher or lower because the residual panel systematically differs from initial cohort.\nWe use Bayesian multilevel models to impute the missing data arising from panel attrition. Our models include a broad range of indicators measured in the baseline year (Time 12) that might affect panel attrition in the following year (Time 13)4. We did not estimate missing predictor values at baseline. These values were excluded. Although exclusion at baseline may result in departure from the population estimate, the time effect estimate is consistent for the population with full response information at baseline. We estimated these models using the brms package in R using the packages default weakly informative priors (Bürkner 2022).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: To handle panel attrition Bayesian models impute missing outcomes\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6 and Table 2 present the results of the Bayesian multilevel imputation models.

    "text": "Bayesian models do change inference\nOverall, New Zealanders do not perceive the risks of COVID-19 to be exaggerated. However, there was somewhat greater perception of exaggeration in 2022 compared with 2021. Here, we speculate about the causes of this dicline. COVID-19 only became widespread in New Zealand after the population was vaccinated. During 2022, about two-million New Zealanders reported testing positive for COVID-19 source, of whom 3239 died within 28 days of their positive test. This low death-to-case-positive ratio perhaps motivate the somewhat greater perception of risk-exaggeration in 2022. The causes of change in risk-exaggeration remain unclear. The overall high rate in the perception of risk accuracy implies effective science communication.\nIn 2022 beliefs that COVID-19 was manufactured in a laboratory increased. At present, there is some scientific disagreement about the origins of COVID-19 (see for example link), even if most evidence points to a natural origin source. Future NZAVS research will investigate whether growing beliefs in a laboratory origin are grounding in confidence in science or tendencies to conspiracy beliefs, or both.\nIn 2022, New Zealanders continued to express high levels of trust in the New Zealand Government’s response to COVID-19. However, levels of trust declined somewhat from where they were in 2021.\nSimilarly, in 2022, New Zealanders continued to express high levels of satisfaction with New Zealand Government’s response to COVID-19. However, levels of trust declined somewhat from where they were in 2021.\nHigh trust and satisfaction with the government’s COVID-19 response might be partially explained by New Zealand’s low COVID-19 death rate. Indeed, the low death rate might also explain waning trust and satisfaction. Suffering was averted. That is satisfying. The averted suffering is not directly observable – it was averted. As such, the averted suffering remains intellectual. By contrast, the economic and social fallout of the pandemic was experienced, and continues to be experienced.\nFuture NZAVS research will systematically investigate the causal basis of trust and satisfaction with the New Zealand Government’s COVID-19 response, which although falling, remains high.5"

It decreased slightly in the post-lockdown period but remained higher than in the pre-Covid period.\nConspiracy Beliefs: the average mistrust of official versions of major world events given by authorities appear to decrease during lockdown but subsequently decrease.\n\nNotably, the central tendency may not always be the interesting statistic for understanding social change. There may be greater galvanisation in response that is masked by overall average response. In future work, we will examine this point. For now, the trends suggest overall stability during 2019-2020, with increasing confidence in science.\n\n\n\nNext, we examine changes in institutional trust across two waves following the 2019/2020 NZAVS wave.\nTable:\n\n\nShow the code\n#|echo: false\n#|warning: false\n\n\n# this code creates a table\n# functions to make tables simple\n\nmy.render.cont <- function(x) {\n  with(stats.apply.rounding(stats.default(x), digits=3), c(\"\",\n                                                           \"Mean (SD)\"=sprintf(\"%s (&plusmn; %s)\", MEAN, SD)))\n}\n\nmy.render.cat <- function(x) {\n  c(\"\", sapply(stats.default(x), function(y) with(y,\n                                                  sprintf(\"%d (%0.0f %%)\", FREQ, PCT))))\n}\n\n# now the years \ntab_trust <- table1::table1(\n  ~ Trust_in_Science +\n    Trust_in_Politicians +\n    Trust_in_Police + # not measured in 2019-20\n    Trust_in_Govt_Covid_Response + \n    Conspiracy_Beliefs| Wave,\n  data = dt,\n  overall = FALSE,\n  render.continuous = my.render.cont,\n  render.categorical = my.render.cat\n)\n\n\n# needed for markdown tables\ntab_trust <- data.frame( tab_trust )\n\ntab_trust <- tab_trust |> \n    rename(\"Forms of Institutional Trust\" = X.)\n\n\n# graph\ntab_trust |>\n  kbl(format = \"markdown\", booktabs = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForms of Institutional Trust\nX2019\nX2020\nX2021\n\n\n\n\n\n(N=42681)\n(N=42681)\n(N=42681)\n\n\nTrust_in_Science\n\n\n\n\n\nMean (SD)\n5.43 (± 1.28)\n5.67 (± 1.24)\n5.70 (± 1.26)\n\n\nMissing\n375 (0.9%)\n9475 (22.2%)\n14231 (33.3%)\n\n\nTrust_in_Politicians\n\n\n\n\n\nMean (SD)\n3.76 (± 1.45)\n4.05 (± 1.49)\n3.92 (± 1.56)\n\n\nMissing\n853 (2.0%)\n10078 (23.6%)\n15406 (36.1%)\n\n\nTrust_in_Police\n\n\n\n\n\nMean (SD)\n4.58 (± 1.26)\n4.53 (± 1.26)\n4.43 (± 1.30)\n\n\nMissing\n15 (0.0%)\n9378 (22.0%)\n13770 (32.3%)\n\n\nTrust_in_Govt_Covid_Response\n\n\n\n\n\nMean (SD)\nNA (± NA)\n5.66 (± 1.55)\n4.79 (± 1.94)\n\n\nMissing\n42681 (100%)\n9620 (22.5%)\n15123 (35.4%)\n\n\nConspiracy_Beliefs\n\n\n\n\n\nMean (SD)\n4.36 (± 1.63)\n4.10 (± 1.68)\n4.02 (± 1.74)\n\n\nMissing\n1197 (2.8%)\n9676 (22.7%)\n15110 (35.4%)\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is a graph of the same.\n\n\nShow the code\n# transform data into long formate\ndt_temp <- dt |> select(\n  Wave,\n  Trust_in_Science,\n  Trust_in_Politicians,\n  Trust_in_Police,\n  Trust_in_Govt_Covid_Response, \n  Conspiracy_Beliefs\n)\n\n\n# boxplot dataframe\ndt_long <- pivot_longer(\n  dt_temp,\n  cols = -c(\"Wave\"),\n  names_prefix = \"Trust_in_\",\n  values_to = \"Values\",\n  names_to = \"Attitudes\"\n) |>\n  drop_na()\n\n\n# make graph\nplot_tab <- dt_long |>\n  ggplot2::ggplot(aes(Wave, Values, fill = Attitudes)) +\n  labs(title = \"Institutional Trust and Conspiracy Beliefs\",\n       subtitle = \"NZ 2019/21 to 2021/22 [N = 42,681 (at baseline)]\") +\n  geom_boxplot(size = .05, notch = T) +\n  scale_fill_okabe_ito() +\n  facet_grid (. ~ Wave, scales = \"free_x\", space = \"free_x\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") +\n  labs(y = \"NZAVS Wave (note: waves cross years)\") + \n  theme_classic()\n\n\nplot_tab\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Boxplot for Institutional Trust: NZAVS Waves 11-13 (years 2019-2022)\n\n\n\n\nDescriptive fndings.\nTrust in Science: The average trust score increased from 5.43 (±1.28) in 2019 to 5.67 (±1.24) in 2020 and to 5.70 (±1.26) in 2021.

Missing data from non-response and panel attrition may bias estimates for the population. We must address bias from missing responses. We address this bias through multiple imputation."

    "text": "Handling missingness\nTo handle missing data, we must model and predict missing responses. We attempt two types of missing data imputation. Both use machine learning. The first is the mlim package in R, which uses model tuning to optimise the prediction of missing values. The second is the mice package in R. It uses predictive mean matching (ppm) optimse the prediction of missing values. We find that the mice package/ppm performs better, and present theppm results here.

We will need to adjust for the uncertainities of multiple imputation using Rubin’s rule.\nAdditionally, we are now grouping pre and post responses together in the 2019 wave. So we are no longer identifying specific responses of to the COVID pandemic and response. To identify the specific effects of the COVID pandemic and response requires care. There are no contrasts from which to derive comparisons. That is, because all in the population were subject to the exposure, we cannot straightforwardly infer how people would have responded were they not exposed. We will return to this issue in future work.\nThese provisos aside, we find evidence for continued average confidence in science, with some evidence for a continued downward shift in trust for the NZ police.\nNext, we formally model change over time using generalised estimating equations (GEE). They models take into account uncertainties from multiple imputation. We employ survey weights to recover population estimates.\n\nResults for average responses.\n\n\nTrust in science\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\n# read output for table\npooled_m_trust_in_science <- readRDS( here::here(push_mods, \"pooled_m_trust_in_science\"))\n\nsummary( pooled_m_trust_in_science ) |> \n  as.data.frame()|> \n  kbl(format = \"markdown\", digits = 3, caption = \"Trust in Science by NZAVS Wave\")\n\n\n\nTrust in Science by NZAVS Wave \n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\ndf\np.value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n5.451\n0.007\n756.404\n62762.541\n0\n\n\nWave2020\n0.192\n0.006\n29.781\n176.552\n0\n\n\nWave2021\n0.215\n0.007\n29.572\n146.591\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\n# read output for table\npooled_m_trust_in_politicians <- readRDS( here::here(push_mods, \"pooled_m_trust_in_politicians\"))\n\n \nsummary( pooled_m_trust_in_politicians ) |> \n  as.data.frame()|> \n  kbl(format = \"markdown\", digits = 3,  caption = \"Trust in Politicians by NZAVS Wave\")\n\n\n\nTrust in Politicians by NZAVS Wave \n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\ndf\np.value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n3.736\n0.008\n441.327\n14871.025\n0\n\n\nWave2020\n0.251\n0.009\n28.251\n93.102\n0\n\n\nWave2021\n0.080\n0.009\n8.803\n259.975\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\n# read output for table\npooled_m_trust_in_police <- readRDS( here::here(push_mods, \"pooled_m_trust_in_police\"))\n\n \nsummary( pooled_m_trust_in_police ) |> \n  as.data.frame()|> \n  kbl(format = \"markdown\", digits = 3,  caption = \"Trust in Police by NZAVS Wave\")\n\n\n\nTrust in Police by NZAVS Wave \n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\ndf\np.value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n4.539\n0.008\n574.900\n103491.441\n0\n\n\nWave2020\n-0.110\n0.007\n-16.752\n111.240\n0\n\n\nWave2021\n-0.247\n0.008\n-31.849\n133.079\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\n# read output for table\npooled_m_trust_in_gov_covid <- readRDS( here::here(push_mods, \"pooled_m_trust_in_gov_covid\"))\n\nsummary( pooled_m_trust_in_gov_covid ) |> \n  as.data.frame()|> \n  kbl(format = \"markdown\", digits = 3, caption = \"Trust in Covid Governemnt Response by NZAVS Wave\")\n\n\n\nTrust in Science by NZAVS Wave \n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\ndf\np.value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n5.614\n0.011\n523.237\n103.496\n0\n\n\nWave2021\n-0.903\n0.011\n-81.429\n67.518\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\n# read output for table\npooled_m_conspiracy_beliefs <- readRDS(  here::here(push_mods, \"pooled_m_conspiracy_beliefs\"))\n\nsummary(pooled_m_conspiracy_beliefs) |> \n  as.data.frame()|> \n  kbl(format = \"markdown\", digits = 3, caption =  \"Conspiracy Beliefs by NZAVS Wave\")\n\n\n\nConspiracy Beliefs by NZAVS Wave \n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\ndf\np.value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n4.362\n0.009\n464.975\n4101.840\n0\n\n\nWave2020\n-0.251\n0.012\n-20.768\n49.163\n0\n\n\nWave2021\n-0.308\n0.013\n-23.368\n48.228\n0\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results reflect findings in the descriptiove tables.\n\nTrust in Science by NZAVS Wave:\n\nFrom 2019 to 2020, trust in science reliably increased (estimate = 0.192, p < 0.001).\nFrom 2019 to 2021, trust in science also reliably increased (estimate = 0.215, p < 0.001).\n\nThere is no downward trend in average Trust in Science.\n\n\nTrust in Politicians by NZAVS Wave:\n\nFrom 2019 to 2020, the increase in trust in politicians was reliable (estimate = 0.251, p < 0.001).\nFrom 2019 to 2021, the increase in trust in politicians was also reliable (estimate = 0.080, p < 0.001).\n\nComparisons here are with the baseline wave, comparing 2019 and 2021 we find evidence for regression to the baseline wave. Whereas trust in politicians increased during the initial COVID-19 attack and response, gains to average trust appear to have been dropping.\n\n\nTrust in Police by NZAVS Wave:\n\nFrom 2019 to 2020, the decrease in trust in police was reliable (estimate = -0.110, p < 0.001).\nFrom 2019 to 2021, the decrease in trust in police was also reliable (estimate = -0.247, p < 0.001).\n\nHere we find evidence for declining Trust in the NZ police. Notably, however, overall levels of Trust in the NZ police remain high.\n\n\nTrust in Government COVID Response by NZAVS Wave (only two waves):\n\nFrom 2019 to 2021, the decrease in trust in the NZ government’s COVID response was reliable (estimate = -0.903, p < 0.001). This represents a major drop in confidence. Notably, this drop in confidence for the NZ government’s COVID response has not considerably affected attitudes to science.\n\n\n\nConspiracy Beliefs:\n\nFrom 2019 to 2020, the decrease in conspiracy beliefs was reliable (estimate = -0.251, p < 0.001).\nFrom 2019 to 2021, the decrease in conspiracy beliefs was also reliable (estimate = -0.308, p < 0.001).\n\nOn average, we find that conspiracy beliefs are falling. However, this evidence is based on the assumptions that the model we have used impute missing conspiracy beliefs is adequate. It is possible that real change in conspiracy beliefs, and indeed for all imputed variables differs from what we have recovered in the imputation model.\n\n\n\nSummary\nThe results indicate a reliable increase in trust in science from 2019 to 2020, and that this shift has remained constant. In contrast, changes in trust in politicians, trust in police, trust in the government’s COVID response, across the waves were generally unreliable. Evidence suggests that average conspiracy beliefs may have declined.\nThe preliminary findings merit further research.\nFirstly, multiple imputation models rely on assumptions. These assumptions must be tested.\nSecondly, when a population becomes more polarized, the average response may be misleading, potentially indicating no change. We must investigate change at the margins of reponse, not merely at the average response.\nThirdly, we need not assume that the items model a univariate latent construct. We might instead model items from the scales individually, as suggested by VanderWeele (2022).\nIn the near future, that address these challenges.
