    "text": "Causal inference\nSuppose we want to infer whether a dichotomous exposure has a causal effect. We must answer three questions:\n\nWhat would happen with exposure?\nWhat would happen with no exposure?\nDo these potential outcomes differ?\n\nConsider a binary exposure \\(A\\) with two levels, \\(A = 0\\) and \\(A=1\\) and a continuous outcome \\(Y\\).  Estimating the causal effect of \\(A\\) on outcome \\(Y\\) requires contrasting two states of the world.  The state of the the world \\(Y^{a=1}\\) when, perhaps contrary to fact, \\(A\\) is set to \\(1\\) and the state of the world \\(Y^{a=0}\\) when, perhaps contrary to fact, \\(A\\) is set to \\(0\\). We say that \\(A\\) affects \\(Y\\)  when the quantities \\(Y^{a=1} - Y^{a=0} \\neq 0\\)(Hernan and Robins 2023).  \n\nThe fundamental problem of causal inference.\nAt any given time, for any individual, at most only one level of the exposure \\(A\\) may be realised. That is, \\(Y^{a=1}\\) and \\(Y^{a=0}\\) are never simultaneously observed in any individual.  As such, individual-level causal effects are not typically identified in the data. This is referred to as “the fundamental problem of causal inference” (Rubin 1976; Gelman, Hill, and Vehtari 2020). \\(Y^{a=1}\\) and \\(Y^{a=0}\\) are therefore called “potential” or “counterfactual” outcomes.\nAlthough we cannot generally observed causal effects in any individual, when certain assumptions are satisfied, we may identify the average or marginal causal effect at the level of a population.  We say there is an average or marginal causal effect if the difference of the averages of those who are exposed and are not exposed does not equal zero:  \\(E(Y^{a=1}) - E(Y^{a=0})\\neq 0\\) . Because the difference of the means is equivalent to the mean of the differences, we may equivalently say there is an marginal causal effect if \\(E(Y^{a=1} - Y^{a=0})\\neq 0\\) (Hernan and Robins 2023). 1 \nCritically, to ensure valid inference, the potential outcomes must be (conditionally) independent of the exposure: \n\\[Y^a  \\perp\\!\\!\\!\\perp A|L\\]\nOr equivalently:\n\\[A \\perp\\!\\!\\!\\perp Y^a |L\\]\nOutside of controlled experiments we cannot generally ensure this conditional independence. For this reason, we use sensitivity analysis, such as the E-value (VanderWeele, Mathur, and Chen 2020)"

    "text": "The steps for G-computation\n\nFirst we fit a regression for each outcome on the exposure \\(A_{t0}\\) and baseline covariates \\(\\boldsymbol{L} = (L_1, L_2,L_3 \\dots L_n)\\). To avoid implausible assumptions of linearity we model the relationship between the exposure each of the potential outcomes of interest using a cubic spline.  We include in the set of baseline confounders \\(\\boldsymbol{L}\\) the baseline measure of the exposure as well as the baseline response (or responses):\n\n\\[\\{A\\_{t-1}, \\boldsymbol{Y_{t-1}} = (Y_{1, t-1}, Y_{2, t-1}, Y_{3, t-1}\\dots Y_{n, t-1})\\} \\subset \\boldsymbol{L}\\]  \nThis gives us\n\\[E(Y|A, \\boldsymbol{L})\\]\n\nSecond, we use the model in (1) to predict the values of a potential outcome \\(Y^{a}\\) by setting the exposure to the value \\(A = a\\).\n\nThis gives us\n\\[\\hat{E}(Y|A = a, \\boldsymbol{L})\\]\n\nThird, we use the model in (1) to predict the values of a different potential outcome \\(Y^{a*}\\)by setting the exposure to a different value of \\(A =a^{\\star}\\).\n\nThis gives us \n\\[\\hat{E}(Y|A = a*,\\boldsymbol{L})\\]\n\nForth we obtain the focal contrast as the expected difference in the expected average outcomes when exposure at levels \\(a*\\) and \\(a\\). Where outcomes are continuous we calculate both mean of \\(Y^a\\) and the mean of  \\(Y^{a*}\\) and then obtain their difference.  This gives us: \n\n\\[\\hat{ATE} = \\hat{E}[\\hat{E}(Y|A = a, \\boldsymbol{L}) - \\hat{E}(Y|A = a*, \\boldsymbol{L})]\\]\n\nWhere outcomes are binary, we calculate the causal risk ratio in moving between the different levels of A. Where binary outcomes are more common than 10% we use a log-normal model to calculate a causal rate ratio (VanderWeele, Mathur, and Chen 2020). \nThe stdReg package in R calculates standard errors using the Delta method from which we construct confidence intervals under asymptotic assumptions(Sjölander 2016). Additionally, we pool uncertainty arising from the multiple imputation procedure by employing Rubin’s Rules."

We may avoid this problem by excluding \\(L_{t+1}\\) from our regression model. To know whether exclusion is warranted requires indexing the relative occurrences of \\(A\\) and \\(L\\). However, without time-series data, we cannot generally know whether \\(L\\) is a cause of \\(A\\) or its effect. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the importance of collecting time-series data to infer causality. Although psychological scientists are familiar with adjustment by regression to address confounding by common cause, we are less familiar with the hazards of over-conditioning.

    "text": "What makes the NZAVS different?\nThe NZAVS is a panel study. A panel study is a longitudinal study that follows the same individuals over time. A panel study is different from a census, which samples the population as a whole over time, without tracking individuals.\nTime-series data within the same individuals across a diverse population are powerful because they enable a systematic understanding of the causal interplay between human social and psychological processes that occur within people as they respond to consequential events in our lives (“natural experiments”).\nThe NZAVS maintains an up-to-date contact list as participants move house, change names, change telephone accounts, and change email addresses. The study’s personalised telephone campaigns, holiday cards, and participant prize draws have enabled the NZAVS to maintain a remarkably high annual sample retention rate of 70-80%. (Many longitudinal studies achieve only 20% retention.)\nEach year, the NZAVS surveys health, personality, relationships, employment, values, beliefs, and habits within the same people. The study has received responses from 69,021 New Zealanders. Its most recent wave (2021/22) received longitudinal responses from over 33,000 New Zealanders. This is about 1% of New Zealand’s adult population. The NZAVS is distinct from other national panel studies for the breadth of its survey questions with broad coverage in political and social psychology, health, and religion/spirituality and for its temporal scale, which encompasses 13 longitudinal waves."

Our interest is in consistently estimating the causal effect of congregation size on each of these outcomes. To consistently estimate the causal effect of an exposure \\(A=1\\) on the vector of well-being outcomes \\(\\boldsymbol{Y}\\) we must ensure that we have included a set of confounders that will prevent any statistical association between \\(A\\) and \\(Y\\) in the absence of causation. A statistical association in the absence of a causal association may arise in one of three ways.: (1) \\(A\\) and \\(Y\\) share a common cause. (2) \\(A\\) and \\(Y\\) share a common effect. (3) There is confounding by descent, such that conditioning on a confounder introduces a statistical association between \\(A\\) and \\(Y\\) in the absence of a casual association (collider bias).\nTo address challenge (1) we may condition or stratify on all measured common causes of \\(A\\) and \\(Y\\). To address challenges (2) and (3), we must not condition on any effect or descendent of an effect. Note however that by conditioning on a descent of a common cause we may at least partially address conditioning by a common cause. This is because conditioning on the effect of a common cause may itself partially block the effect of the that common cause.\nIn NZAVS outcome-wide science studies we use a modified version of VanderWeele et al’s approach for estimating outcome-wide causal effects (VanderWeele, Mathur, and Chen 2020).\nVanderWeele’s approach utilises three waves of panel data collected within the same participants over time.\nCall \\(t-1\\) the baseline wave, \\(t_0\\) the exposure wave, and \\(t+1\\) the outcome measurement wave. First, we include at baseline indicators of all past outcomes \\(\\boldsymbol{Y}_{t-1}\\). Second, we include at baseline an indicator for the past exposure \\(A_{t-1}\\). Third, we include a rich set of baseline confounders \\(\\boldsymbol{L_{t-1}}\\). Of course, we cannot ensure that this strategy is sufficient to ensure no unmeasured confounding. However, on On VanderWeele’s strategy, for any unmeasured confounder to affect both the exposure/outcome association, it would need to do so independently of its effects on prior measurements of the exposure and (all) outcomes at baseline, in addition to all measured baseline confounders. Note also that by controlling for measured confounders the wave prior to exposure we avoid unwittingly conditioning on an effects of the exposure that subsequently affects the outcome – mediator bias. Note furthermore that by measuring the outcome in the year following the exposure, \\(Y_{t+1}\\), we ensure that the exposure temporally precedes the outcome, and is not, for example, an effect of the outcome. Finally, loss-to-follow-up or attrition, as well as survey non-response may introduce selection bias (represented by the boxed \\(S_{t+1}\\)). There are several ways in which uch selection bias may introduce confounding. In Figure 1, we note the prospect in which a novel common cause of \\(A\\) and \\(Y\\) called \\(U_s\\) may lead to a spurious association between \\(A\\) and \\(Y\\) if \\(S\\) is a collider of \\(A\\) and \\(U_s\\). To avoid selection bias we multiply impute the missing responses.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nVanderWeele, Tyler J, Maya B Mathur, and Ying Chen. 2020. “Outcome-Wide Longitudinal Designs for Causal Inference: A New Template for Empirical Studies.” Statistical Science 35 (3): 437466.\n\nReuseCC BY-NC-SACitationBibTeX citation:@online{2022,\n  author = {},\n  title = {Outcome-Wide {Science} in {NZAVS} {Studies}},\n  date = {2022-11-05},\n  url = {https://go-bayes.github.io/b-causal-lab/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\n“Outcome-Wide Science in NZAVS Studies.” 2022.

    "text": "Follow up: Bayesian models impute missing outcomes arising from loss to follow up\nPanel studies follow the same people over time. There is typically attrition of any panel over time. Where attrition is related to the outcomes of interest, this can lead to selection bias. That is, responses can be higher or lower because the residual panel systematically differs from initial cohort.\nWe use Bayesian multilevel models to impute the missing data arising from panel attrition. Our models include a broad range of indicators measured in the baseline year (Time 12) that might affect panel attrition in the following year (Time 13)4. We did not estimate missing predictor values at baseline. These values were excluded. Although exclusion at baseline may result in departure from the population estimate, the time effect estimate is consistent for the population with full response information at baseline. We estimated these models using the brms package in R using the packages default weakly informative priors (Bürkner 2022).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: To handle panel attrition Bayesian models impute missing outcomes\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6 and ?@tbl-cap present the results of the Bayesian multilevel imputation models.

    "text": "Bayesian models do change inference\nOverall, New Zealanders do not perceive the risks of COVID-19 to be exaggerated. However, there was somewhat greater perception of exaggeration in 2022 compared with 2021. Here, we speculate about the causes of this dicline. COVID-19 only became widespread in New Zealand after the population was vaccinated. During 2022, about two-million New Zealanders reported testing positive for COVID-19 source, of whom 3239 died within 28 days of their positive test. This low death-to-case-positive ratio perhaps motivate the somewhat greater perception of risk-exaggeration in 2022. The causes of change in risk-exaggeration remain unclear. The overall high rate in the perception of risk accuracy implies effective science communication.\nIn 2022 beliefs that COVID-19 was manufactured in a laboratory increased. At present, there is some scientific disagreement about the origins of COVID-19 (see for example link), even if most evidence points to a natural origin source. Future NZAVS research will investigate whether growing beliefs in a laboratory origin are grounding in confidence in science or tendencies to conspiracy beliefs, or both.\nIn 2022, New Zealanders continued to express high levels of trust in the New Zealand Government’s response to COVID-19. However, levels of trust declined somewhat from where they were in 2021.\nSimilarly, in 2022, New Zealanders continued to express high levels of satisfaction with New Zealand Government’s response to COVID-19. However, levels of trust declined somewhat from where they were in 2021.\nHigh trust and satisfaction with the government’s COVID-19 response might be partially explained by New Zealand’s low COVID-19 death rate. Indeed, the low death rate might also explain waning trust and satisfaction. Suffering was averted. That is satisfying. The averted suffering is not directly observable – it was averted. As such, the averted suffering remains intellectual. By contrast, the economic and social fallout of the pandemic was experienced, and continues to be experienced.\nFuture NZAVS research will systematically investigate the causal basis of trust and satisfaction with the New Zealand Government’s COVID-19 response, which although falling, remains high.5"

Suppose further that childhood schooling, an unmeasured cause, affects both forgiveness and perfectionism. Next, suppose that childhood religion, which is also unmeasured, affects both forgiveness and humility. By assumption, perfectionism is not causally associated with humility. Notice however that adjusting for forgiveness opens a back-door path from perfectionism to humility. This occurs because forgiveness is a collider confounder of childhood schooling and childhood religion. By including forgiveness, we open a path between these two unmeasured parameters which then opens an association from perfectionism to humility along the path.

    "text": "The causal crisis in psychological science will not be addressed without time-series data\nTheoretically, a minimal adjustment set will suffice to prevent confounding. Given that a minimal adjustment set is sufficient, and given the threat of over-adjustment bias, many advise parsimony when selecting variables for confounding control (McElreath 2020). Although we are sympathetic to these arguments, we cannot generally know the true causal structure of reality. We agree with those who admonish researchers to collect repeated-measures time series data. With at least three waves of data we may (1) condition on confounders that are measured before the exposure, (2) model the effect of an exposure that is measured before an outcome, and (3) include measures both of the exposure and of the outcome at baseline in our set of baseline confounders. Such a strategy greatly eases the worry of unintentionally conditioning on a mediator or on a common effect of the exposure and the outcome — the two strongest motivations for parsimony. Additionally, if we adopted a modified disjunctive criterion that includes baselines measures of the exposure and outcome the the hypothetical threat of over-conditioning from pre-exposure colliders is further reduced. Far more important than parsimony is collecting repeated measures time-series data. Such data collection is too rarely attempted in psychological sciences. The causal crisis in psychological science will not be solved by the application of causal diagrams to one or two waves of data (see: (Bulbulia 2022)). Need are data collected on individuals over time."
