## Purpose

Causation occurs in time. Therefore, investigating the relationship between cause and effect requires time series data. 

Causality is also dynamic. Where there is Treatment-Confounder Feedback, the relationship between cause and effect cannot be identified using standard regression methods, including multi-level regression and structural equation models. Instead, special methods - "G-methods" - are needed. 

Here, I use three causal graphs to describe a problem of treatment-confounder feedback, and direct readers to G-methods for its solution.

## My assumptions about you

1. You are interested in psychological science.
2. You understand how to read causal graphs ^[I will soon write a tutorial here for those who are unfamiliar]
3. Your "go-to" method for time-series analysis is either a latent growth curve or a multi-level model. 

## Confounding by Common Cause

Suppose we wish to compute the causal effect of treatment $A$ on outcome $Y$. Because $L$ is a common cause of both $A$ and $Y$, $L$ will lead to an association between $A$ and $Y$. We face *confounding by common cause*. The good news: where $L$ is measured, a regression model that conditions on $L$ will break the association between $A$ and $Y$. Again, causation occurs in time. We index measured nodes to ensure our data adhere to time's arrow

```{tikz}
\usetikzlibrary{positioning}
\usetikzlibrary{shapes.geometric}
\usetikzlibrary{arrows}
\usetikzlibrary{decorations}
\tikzstyle{Arrow} = [->, thin, preaction = {decorate}]
\tikzset{>=latex}

\begin{tikzpicture}[squarednode/.style={rectangle, draw=gray!90, fill=gray!5, auto}]
\tikzset{>=latex}
\tikzstyle{Arrow} = [->, thin, preaction = {decorate}]
\tikzstyle{DoubleArrow} = [-, preaction = {decorate}]
\node[squarednode] (1) {$L_{t-1}$};
\node[right =of 1] (2) {$A_{t}$};
\node[right =of 2] (3) {$Y_{t+1}$};
\draw[Arrow,bend left] (1) to (3);
\draw[Arrow] (1) to (2);
\end{tikzpicture}
```

## Confounding by Over-Conditioning

Suppose $L_{t+1}$ is an effect of $A_{t}$. To condition on the common effect will induce a spurious association between $A_t$ and $Y_{t+1}$ through the unmeasured confounder $U$ (red path). We may avoid this problem by excluding $L_{t+1}$ from our regression model. To know whether exclusion is warranted requires indexing the relative occurrences of $A$ and $L$. However, without time-series data, we cannot generally know whether $L$ is a cause of $A$ or its effect. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the importance of collecting time-series data to infer causality. Although psychological scientists are familiar with adjustment by regression to address confounding by common cause, we are less familiar with the hazards of over-conditioning. Generally, **confounding control in any observational science requires time series data**.

```{tikz}
\usetikzlibrary{positioning}
\usetikzlibrary{shapes.geometric}
\usetikzlibrary{arrows}
\usetikzlibrary{decorations}
\tikzstyle{Arrow} = [->, thin, preaction = {decorate}]
\tikzset{>=latex}

\begin{tikzpicture}
%\node [draw=none, align=center, font=\small] at (2,1) {\bf Condition on child of collider};
\node [draw = none, inner sep = 1] (U) at (0, 0) {$U$};
\node [draw = none, inner sep = 1] (A) at (.75, 0) {$A_{0}$};
\node [rectangle, draw=red, thick](L) at (1.75, 0) {$L_{1}$};
\node [draw = none, inner sep = 1] (Y) at (3, 0) {$Y_{2}$};
\draw [-latex, bend right=30, draw = red] (U) to (L);
\draw [-latex, bend left = 30, draw=red] (U) to (Y);
\draw [-latex,draw=red] (A) to (L);
\end{tikzpicture}
```

## Confounding control for Treatment-Confounder Feedback: Damned if you condition damned if you do not.

Suppose we collect time series data. Suppose further that conditioning on $L$ blocks an unmeasured common cause $U$ of future treatments $A$ and future outcomes $Y$. Suppose further, as in Figure 2, past states of $A$ affect future states of $L$. Notice, regression faces a *damned-if-we-do-damned-if-we-don't* adjustment challenge. On the one hand, to avoid confounding by a common cause we must adjust for $L$ at all time points. On the other hand, adjusting for $L_{t+1}$ induces confounding by over-conditioning (paths in red). \*\*Regression, including multi-level regression and structural equation models, must be abandoned.\* There are alternatives to regression called G-methods that may address treatment-confounder feedback. One of these methods, the Marginal Structural Model, replaces $L$ with inverse probability weights for the exposure. G-methods are described in Chapters 12 and 13 of Hernan and Robin's[@hernan2023][^1]

[^1]: We draw the minimum number of paths to clarify the problem.

## Importance

I write this report to encourage psychological scientists to (1) collect time-series data and (2) address treatment-confounder feedback by employing G-methods. I do not write this report to cast stones. My published work offers ample illustrations of the problems that I describe here. On a positive note, a causal revolution in psychological science is upon us. Our best science remains ahead of us [@vanderweele2015].
