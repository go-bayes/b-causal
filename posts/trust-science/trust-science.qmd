## NZAVS Report on Institutional Trust Pre/Post COVID

This report delves into the changes in institutional trust among New Zealanders from the pre-pandemic period in 2019 to 2022.

The New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study uses a two-item scale to measure **Trust in Science**

-   "I have a high degree of confidence in the scientific community."[@nisbet2015]

-   "Our society places too much emphasis on science."(reverse coded) 

We average these scores to form a single score [@hartman2017].[^We do not blindly adhere to the standard measurement approaches in psychometrics.  It might be preferable to work with single items instead of the averaged score. See [@vanderweele2022] for more information on this point.]

These items were introduced in NZAVS Wave 11 (2019 - 2020) \[\^ We must be cautious: causal identification requires contrasting outcomes under different exposures.  Because all were exposed to the COVID-19 pandemic, these contrasts are not identified without the strong assumption that there were no pre-existing trends in the acceptance of science before the COVID-19 pandemic struck.\]

Previous research using a propensity score design reported on changes in Trust in Science during the first three weeks of New Zealand's COVID lockdown in March and April 2020 [@sibley2020].

**COVID-19 Government response** [@marques2022]

-   "I trust the Government to make sensible decisions about how to best manage COVID-19 in New Zealand."
-   "The New Zealand government response to COVID-19."

**Trust in politicians** [@sibley2020]

-   "Politicians in New Zealand can generally be trusted."

**Institutional trust in police** [@tyler2005]

-   "People's basic rights are well protected by the New Zealand Police."
-   "There are many things about the New Zealand Police and its policies that need to be changed."
-   "The New Zealand Police care about the well-being of everyone they deal with."

**General tendency to believe in conspiracies**[@lantian2016]

-   "I think that the official version of major world events given by authorities often hides the truth."

This table and graph compare the trust in science, police, and politicians across three different periods: pre-Covid, lockdown, and post-lockdown.

We observe:

1.  Trust in science increased during the lockdown period and remained higher in the post-lockdown period compared to the pre-Covid period.
2.  Trust in police remained relatively stable across all three periods, although the trend tracked downward after lockdown.
3.  Trust in politicians increased during the lockdown period. It decreased slightly in the post-lockdown period but remained higher than in the pre-Covid period.
4. Conspiracy Beliefs: the average mistrust of official versions of major world events given by authorities appear to increase during lockdown but subsequently decrease.

Importantly, the graph suggests that while the mean of trust in science increased, so too did the density of people at the extremes of the scale. 

This finding suggests galvanisation in attitudes to science in New Zealand. 

This finding is also a reminder that a central tendency may not always be the most interesting statistic for understanding social change.


### NZAVS sample responses: years 2019-2022

Next, we examine changes in institutional trust across two waves following the 2019/2020 NZAVS wave. It is crucial to consider the potential bias caused by panel attrition. If institutional trust is linked to attrition, an analysis limited to the observed sample may not accurately reflect changes across the country. Despite the use of prize draws as incentives in the NZAVS, individuals who lose trust in science might be less likely to continue participating, potentially introducing bias in the results.

Findings in the naive analysis:

Trust in Science: The average trust score increased from 5.43 (±1.28) in 2019 to 5.67 (±1.24) in 2020 and to 5.70 (±1.26) in 2021. The number of missing values increased from 375 (0.9%) in 2019 to 9,475 (22.2%) in 2020 and further to 14,231 (33.3%) in 2021.

Trust in Politicians: The average trust score increased from 3.76 (±1.45) in 2019 to 4.05 (±1.49) in 2020, then slightly decreased to 3.92 (±1.56) in 2021. The number of missing values increased from 853 (2.0%) in 2019 to 10,078 (23.6%) in 2020 and further to 15,406 (36.1%) in 2021.

Trust in Police: The average trust score decreased from 4.58 (±1.26) in 2019 to 4.53 (±1.26) in 2020 and further to 4.43 (±1.30) in 2021. The number of missing values increased from 15 (0.0%) in 2019 to 9,378 (22.0%) in 2020 and further to 13,770 (32.3%) in 2021.

Trust in Government's COVID Response: This metric was not applicable in 2019. The average trust score was 5.66 (±1.55) in 2020 and decreased to 4.79 (±1.94) in 2021. The number of missing values was 42,681 (100%) in 2019, 9,620 (22.5%) in 2020, and 15,123 (35.4%) in 2021.

Conspiracy Beliefs: The average score decreased from 4.36 (±1.63) in 2019 to 4.10 (±1.68) in 2020 and further to 4.02 (±1.74) in 2021. The number of missing values increased from 1,197 (2.8%) in 2019 to 9,676 (22.7%) in 2020 and further to 15,110 (35.4%) in 2021.

How should we in interpret these findings?  Again, missing data from non-response and panel attrition may bias estimates for the population. We must address bias from missing responses.



## Handling missingness

To handle missing data, we must model and predict missing responses. We attempt two types of missing data imputation. Both use machine learning. The first is the `mlim` package in R, which uses model tuning to optimise the prediction of missing values. The second is the `mice` package in R.  It uses predictive mean matching (ppm) optimse the prediction of missing values.  We find that the mice package/ppm performs better, and present the`ppm` results here. We present the code for both approaches below.

```{r mlim}
#| eval: false
#| echo: false

# Impute
# conflicts may prevent from running
library("mlim")
library("missForest")
library("mice")

  ) |>
 # dplyr::select(-c(starts_with("t1") & !starts_with("t1_Warm."))) |>

The imputed data contain ten imputed datasets plus the original data with missing values.  We will need to adjust for the uncertainities of multiple imputation using Rubin's rule.

However, for descriptive purposes, we note there is is initial evidence for a declining institutional trust in politicians and the police, which was not as clearly evident in the analysis that ingored missing values  

Next, we formally model change over time using generalised estimating equations, again taking into account uncertainties from multiple imputation.

#### Trust in Science by NZAVS Wave:

- From 2019 to 2020, trust in science reliably increased (estimate = 0.228, p < 0.001).
- From 2019 to 2021, the increase in trust in science was not reliable (estimate = 0.263, p = 0.289). 


####  Trust in Politicians by NZAVS Wave:

- From 2019 to 2020, the increase in trust in politicians was large not reliable (estimate = 0.139, p = 0.790).
- From 2019 to 2021, the decrease in trust in politicians was not reliable (estimate = -0.093, p = 0.923).


#### Trust in Police by NZAVS Wave:

- From 2019 to 2020, the decrease in trust in police was not reliable (estimate = -0.094, p = 0.875).
- From 2019 to 2021, the decrease in trust in police was large but not reliable (estimate = -0.374, p = 0.516).


#### Trust in Government COVID Response by NZAVS Wave (only two waves):

From 2019 to 2021, the decrease in trust in the government's COVID response was large but not reliable (estimate = -0.911, p = 0.477).

#### Conspiracy Beliefs:

- From 2019 to 2020, the increase in conspiracy beliefs was not reliable (estimate = 0.249, p = 0.417).
From 2019 to 2021, the decrease in conspiracy beliefs was not reliable (estimate = -0.063, p = 0.927).

### Summary

The results indicate a reliable increase in trust in science from 2019 to 2020, and that this shift has remained constant. In contrast, changes in trust in politicians, trust in police, trust in the government's COVID response, and conspiracy beliefs across the waves were generally unreliable. This suggests that, on average, trust in science has improved, while other forms of trust and beliefs have not shown consistent or reliable changes over time in the average response. However, our analysis should not end here.

Firstly, the multiple imputation, which we require to handle missingness, introduces considerable uncertainty.

Secondly, when a population becomes more polarized, the average response may be misleading, potentially indicating no change.

Overall, the evidence points to a decline in average levels of institutional trust following COVID, particularly concerning the New Zealand Government's COVID response. Yet, the evidence does not suggest a widespread loss in average scientific confidence.

In the near future, we will explore models that provide insights beyond the average response and better account for uncertainty. Stay tuned!
